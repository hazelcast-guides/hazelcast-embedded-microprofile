:description: In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Hazelcast within Microprofile microservices.

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

{description}

The Microprofile application contains three endpoints that help you to put, read, and list the data.

You can either prefer using Hazelcast client to connect an existing Hazelcast cluster (Client/Server mode) or create Hazelcast
instances along with your Microprofile servers to form a new cluster (Embedded mode).

In client mode, the application connects to an existing Hazelcast cluster. In this setup, the client is not responsible
for holding any data but fetching/putting data from/to the Hazelcast cluster.

In embedded mode, the application initializes a single Hazelcast member instance which is used to keep the data.
When you run the application multiple times, Hazelcast members build a cluster and share the data.

See https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#hazelcast-topology[documentation] for the details on
client/server and embedded topologies.

== Configure Hazelcast

Note that if you will use embedded Hazelcast instances, members will be created within your application and
form a cluster automatically. However, if you will use Hazelcast client, you need to have a running Hazelcast
cluster. You can have one with one of these methods:
include::{templates-url}/start-hz-cluster.adoc[]
{empty} +

Let's configure our HazelcastInstance in `HazelcastApplication.java`:

[tabs]
====
Client::
+
--

[source, java]
----
@Produces
HazelcastInstance create() {
    ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
    // configure existing Hazelcast cluster address to be connected.
    clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("127.0.0.1:5701");
    return HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
}
----
--

Embedded::
+
--
NOTE: Maps need to be configured in member configuration, not client.
[source, java]
----
@Produces
HazelcastInstance create() {
    Config config = new Config();
    // all other configurations (networking,
    // listeners, etc.) can be set here.
    MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig();
    mapConfig.setName(MAP_NAME);
    mapConfig.setTimeToLiveSeconds(30);
    config.addMapConfig(mapConfig);
    return Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
}
----
--
====

`create()` method will supply HazelcastInstance wherever it is injected:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
HazelcastInstance instance;
----

Now that we have a HazelcastInstance, we can reach to the distributed map over the instance:

[source, java]
----
private IMap<Integer,String> getDistributedMap() {
    return instance.getMap(HazelcastApplication.MAP_NAME);
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The map will have 30 seconds of time-to-live if it's configured to do so:
[source, java]
----
MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig();
mapConfig.setName(MAP_NAME);
mapConfig.setTimeToLiveSeconds(30);
config.addMapConfig(mapConfig);
----
Be aware that this needs to be done on member configuration before it starts, not on client configuration.
====

And that's all! The distributed map is ready to use now.
[source, java]
----
IMap<Integer,String> map = getDistributedMap();
map.put(1, "value");
map.get(1);
map.putIfAbsent(1, "another_value");
----

== Run the Microprofile Application

Now, let's build the servers and then deploy the applications.

----
$ mvn clean install
----

Start the first server listening on port 9080:

----
$ mvn -pl server1 liberty:run-server
----

In another terminal session, start the second server listening on port 9081:

----
$ mvn -pl server2 liberty:run-server
----

After two servers are up and ready, you will see the logs:

----
The HazelcastGuides1 server is ready to run a smarter planet.
...
The HazelcastGuides2 server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Let's give it a try:

----
$ curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9080/application/map/put?key=1&value=greetings_from_server1"
Put: greetings_from_server1. Old value was: null

$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9081/application/map/get?key=1"
{ 1 : greetings_from_server1 }

$ curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9081/application/map/put?key=2&value=cool"
Put: cool. Old value was: null

$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:9080/application/map/list"
Size: 2
{ 1: greetings_from_server1 }
{ 2: cool }
----

Note that after 30 seconds, these values will be evicted if the map is configured properly.

== Summary

In this tutorial, you developed a simple application that uses Hazelcast to store the data.
When you started two application instances, if they used Hazelcast client, they connected to a
Hazelcast cluster and share the same map for fetching and storing data. Otherwise in embedded mode,
the applications also created Hazelcast instances and they formed a cluster on their own to share
data among them. In both cases, you could access the same data from both application instances.
